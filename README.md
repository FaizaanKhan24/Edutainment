## Milestone Project 4-6
## Multiplication table game

### About

The application UI/UX is basic. This project is completed on the idea of button actions and functions. 

### How the applicaiton works

- At first the user is given a landing page. The user gets to select the table and number of question they want
- After selecting the setting, they are redirected to the page page
- The score is shown on top, along with question number 
- There are already an array of questions ready, each question is shown one by one
- Once the user answers the question, they are given if the answer is right or wrong
- Once all the questions are done. The game restarts 

### Extra
- The user can give a empty answer if they do not know the answer and they wanna pass this question
